### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Practical

This is a practical for SVM model machine learning classification model. 

The goal is to group predict customer retention base on certain characteristics of the customer such as age and income. The target vairable for which we are trying to predict is `churn` 

Before we dive into the practical, here is an overview of key steps in the practical:
* Loading the required libraries
* Data processing and exploration
* Data modelling
* Insight and model evaluation

**The data for this practical was obtained from the IBM cloud storage**
